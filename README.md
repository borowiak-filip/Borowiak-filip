## Filip Borowiak

Hi 👋🏽 My name is Filip! <br>
I am trained Mechatronics and Computer Scientist, currenlty Studying MSc in Artificial Intelligence at the University of St Andrews in Scotland 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿. <br>
My recent work focuses on applied AI in autonomous systems ⚛️, however I do good old fashion software engineering from time to time 💻. <br>
The areas of AI & ML I am particularly interested in are: RL, search, planning, decision making, optimisation, computer vision, and theory of mind 🤖🧠.
